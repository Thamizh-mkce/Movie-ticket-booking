# Movie Booking Platform

This is a simple web-based movie booking platform where users can select a movie, choose a showtime, and book tickets.

## Features
- Select a movie from a dropdown list.
- Choose a showtime based on the selected movie.
- Display booking details and enable ticket booking only when both a movie and showtime are selected.
- Confirmation alert when tickets are booked.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the movie booking interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the booking interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that manages movie and showtime selection, and handles the booking logic.

## Setup
1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Open the Application**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. **Usage**:
   - Select a movie from the "Select Movie" dropdown.
   - After selecting a movie, choose a showtime from the "Select Showtime" dropdown.
   - The booking button will be enabled once both movie and showtime are selected.
   - Click the "Book Tickets" button to book your tickets. A confirmation alert will appear.

## How It Works
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure for the movie selection, showtime selection, and booking functionality.
- **CSS**: Styles the elements to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the interaction logic, including updating available showtimes based on the selected movie and enabling the booking button when appropriate. It also displays booking details and shows a confirmation alert when tickets are booked.
